This knowledge would provide users the ability to make logical decision about the geometry of CFD domain, choice of proper boundary conditions and numerical models for the CFD simulation. Furthermore, user will have a general big picture on the expected outcome of simulation. These knowledges and abilities form the foundation for a successful implementation and validation of the CFD simulation.**\n",

    "One of the most fundamental study of fluid dynamics is about properties of flow around a blunt object. Flow over a cylinder is the basis of this field. Given a cylindrical object of a fixed dimension, the behavior of the flow is dependent on the Reynolds number, which is a dimensionless quantity widely applied in fluid dynamics.\n",

    "In any fluid dynamics research, a control volume(*CV*) must be defined before other physical properties. By definition, a *Control Volume* is an inertial frame of reference within the continuum of a flow. As in this specific study, where flow is incompressible, a fixed *Control Volume* of any size satisfies our need. Thus, we could set a *Control Volume* to a specific area to study the flow within.\n",
    "\n",
    "Normally, given a *Control Volume* in a continuum, there are three major physical properties that are conservative within this *Control Volume*: **mass**, **momentum** and **energy**. In this very stage of the research, we don't consider any heat exchanging processes, that is, the energy conservation is always satisfied. Thus, we only consider the **conservation of mass and momentum** in order to study the flow behavior over a cylinder."

    "Obtaining the velocity field, we understand how the cylinder is affecting the flow. And to know the effect the flow put on the cylinder, we set our focus on the forces. There are two kinds of force acting on the cylinder, the one going streamwise, called the **drag force**, and the one perpendicular to the flow direction, named the **lift force**. Due to the symmetry of velocity field, the lift acting on the cylinder is always *zero*. Thus, the **drag** become the most important force that we want to study.\n",

The value of this momentum is calculated using $\\rho$ as the reference density of the flow, which is the density of the flow. $V$ as the undisturbed streamwise flow velocity in the inlet and $A$, which is the projected area of the cylinder surface. For a two-dimensional cylinder the projected area is equal to the diameter of the cylinder. This is the area where pressure and viscous forces are acting on the cylinder in the streamwise direction. It should be noted that the pressure and viscous forces in the perpendicular direction to streamwise direction cancel each other. Hence, the forces and areas that they act on does not have any contribution to the drag force and coefficient.\n"

    "As we can tell from the analysis above, both calculating the velocity field and the drag force need a lot of efforts. This is particularly true if one want to reach a high accuracy, let along dealing with some more complex situation. This is when computational fluid dynamics, or **CFD**, come into place. With the help of CFD, one can divide the area of interest into multiple small *control volumes*,called meshes, where a steady state is always satisfied. Once input the physical settings for the flow, the computer can finish the calculation without consuming much human power. Thus, with proper meshing methods and input parameters, CFD is an effective approach to obtain the velocity field and drag coefficient."
